*Maze Race* is a multiplayer game for Android mobile hotspot networks.
One of the players opens a hotspot (this player has the role of *table manager*),
and other players join that hotspot.

Up to 4 players can sit at the corners of the *game table* at a time.
It is not mandatory to join the table in all rounds (even if you're the
*table manager*). You can remain a *spectator*, and watch the game
on your device without participating. This can be useful when more than
4 people want to play.

In each round, the *table manager* decides the size of the maze to generate,
(between 10x10 and 25x25), and starts the game when all players are ready.
A random maze gets generated, and appears on the devices of all players and
spectators. Players are represented as squares inside the maze (beginning
at the corner corresponding to their place at the table), but each player
sees his/her own representation as a ball instead of a square.

Players should tilt their devices in order to get the ball to the opposite
corner of the maze. The first player to do so, wins the round.

When you don't run a hotspot or connect to one, *Maze Race* runs in *single player* mode,
where you're the *table manager* of a *game table* only you can join.
