*Maze Race* is a multiplayer game for Android mobile hotspot networks.

You're currently connected to somebody else's hotspot.
We'll call this person the *table manager*.

Up to 4 players can join the *game table* at a time, but others can
still be connected as *spectators* (who can watch the game on their own
phones/tablets), and join as soon as one of the players leaves the table.

To play
-------

* Make sure the *game manager* is running the app (if not —
  the text *Game: offline* would appear top right).
* Join the game by choosing a nickname for yourself and clicking **Join**.
* Your nickname will appear in one of the corners of the *game table*.
* Once all players are ready and decide on the maze's size,
  the *game manager* will start the game. 
  After the maze is drawn —
  a ball will appear in the corner corresponding to your corner
  in the *game table*. Other players will be represented as boxes.
* Tilt your phone/tablet in order to get the ball to the opposite
  corner of the maze (the *goal corner*).
* The first player to reach his/her *goal corner* wins the round.
