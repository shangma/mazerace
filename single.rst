*Maze Race* is a multiplayer game for Android mobile hotspot networks.
Currently you're in *single player* mode, which means you're the *table manager*
of a *game table* only you can join.

To play
-------

* Join the game by choosing a nickname for yourself and clicking **Join**
  (this, of course, makes more sense in a multiplayer game).
* Use the slider to select the size of the maze.
* Click **Go**. It will take some time to draw the maze, and then â€”
  a ball will appear inside it.
* Tilt your phone/tablet in order to get the ball to the opposite
  corner of the maze.

To run in *multi player* mode
-----------------------------

* Exit the app.
* Either open a mobile hotspot others can join, or join somebody
  else's mobile hotspot.
* Restart the app.

If you are the one running the hotspot (aka the *table manager*),
it is advised (for security reasons) to:

* Configure the hotspot with a password.
* Disable your mobile data connection.
