*Maze Race* is a multiplayer game for Android mobile hotspot networks.

Up to 4 players can join the *game table* at a time, but others can
still be connected as *spectators* (who can watch the game on their own
phones/tablets), and join as soon as one of the players leaves the table.

You're the one running the hostspot, which means that **you** are the
*table manager*.

It is important that you keep your app running so that others can play.
You don't need to play all games (i.e. you can leave the *game table*
and remain a *spectator*).

To start a game (once all players are ready and have agreed on the maze's size),
use the slider to set the size, and click **Go**.
